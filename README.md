# Graphics Programming with SDL3
Some messing around with SDL on MacOS. This will, 99% of the time, not work on your machine <3.

## Setup
If you're crazy enough to try to get this working, you'll need decently modern `gcc`, `make`, and `cmake` (for compiling SDL). Then, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tnevins-klein/graphics-experiments
cd graphics-experiments
make libs
make
```
Then, to run the program, run
```
./bin/game
```

Cheers!
